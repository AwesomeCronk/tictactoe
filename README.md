This is my basic implementation of a tic-tac-toe (noughts-and-crosses) game. Set players X and/or O to `menace` followed by something else in order to set up a MENACE bot for that player. MENACE bots will save their configuration in a file with the bot's name followed by the `.mnc` extension. Game stats will be stored in a file called `stats.txt`. All files will be stored in the working directory. Python 3 is required. Written and tested using Python 3.8.
